		<h2 class="title">The Archetypal Literature for the Future.</h2>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">If</span> the science of man, the being in whom the spiritual and material
		worlds are fully represented, and in whom both can be studied
		in their relations, has been fully (though not completely or
		finally) developed by the revelation through experiments, of the functions
		of the brain, then from the establishment of anthropology
		there necessarily begins a literary revolution, which not only
		changes all philosophy, but extends through all the realms of literature.
		There is no realm which can escape the modifying influence
		of ideas which are at the basis of all conceptions of man, of society,
		of duty, of religion, of art, of social institutions, of the healing art,
		education, and government, and the new light which psychometric
		illumination throws upon all sciences.</p>

		<p>The literature of the future will therefore differ widely from the
		literature of the past, and millions of volumes which still hold their
		places on the shelves of libraries will in the next century take their
		proper place in the mouldering mass which interests the antiquarian
		alone,—the mouldering mass which universities still cherish,
		and which helps to deaden the rising intelligence of the western world.
		Let us, as Tennyson says,</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<p>“Hope the best, but hold the Present</p>
			<p>Fatal daughter of the Past.”</p>
		</div>

		<p>It is self-evident that the farther back we go for intelligence the
		deeper we plunge in the darkness of ignorance; and even though
		intuitional and moral truths may be found in the old writings, they
		belong to a literature imbedded in an ignorance which necessarily
		darkens all that comes down from such periods.</p>

		<p>The benumbing influence of antiquity—or rather of that
		extended period which may be called the Aristotelian age, the age in
		which all philosophic thought was utterly benumbed by the Greek
		literature—has not yet passed away. American writers are just
		beginning to get rid of their absolute subserviency to foreign models
		in all things, and in this partial independence they are still subservient
		to the fundamental philosophic and ethical ideas of the past.
		The change that is taking place is only in minor matters.</p>

		<p>Even so graceful and able a writer as Longfellow illustrates fully
		the truth of these suggestions. Mr. Charles F. Johnson, in a well-written
		essay on Longfellow, Emerson, and Hawthorne, says:</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>“Most people feel that national temper is of slow evolution; that
		many heterogeneous elements must be fused and blended here; that
		we too must have a past, and that the spirit of our past must be
		taken up and transmitted before a new type is realized in a new art
		and a new literature. We can see that Longfellow was essentially
		a scholar—a receiver of impressions from books; that he was like
		an Æolian harp, blown upon by many winds, so that his music was
		in many regards necessarily a melodious echo of what was ‘whispered
		by world-wandering winds.’ And we can see, too, that he came into
		American literary life just as it was passing from the germ to the
		plant, and that every year he became more distinctive.”</p>

		<p>There is nothing profound in this view, but it expresses well the
		average thought of the period,—that Americanism in literature
		must be the very gradual growth of new circumstances, experience,
		and associations, which may superficially modify the unbroken mass
		of thought which has been transplanted from Europe, just as vines
		and flowers take on their modifications in a new soil and climate.</p>

		<p>Far different from this is the view that anthropology gives us.
		The foreign plant, it is true, will gradually change, but a native
		plant will ultimately take its place by the law of the “survival of
		the fittest.” The exotic must die out, for it was but a hothouse
		plant, reared in universities and cathedrals.</p>

		<p>The thought, the science, the philosophy, and even the forms of
		literary expression, for this continent, will be those which spring
		from the bosom of nature, fresh and strong, imbued with the spiritual
		element of immortality, the element of luminous originality.</p>

		<p>How and whence is this to come? It will come by the complete
		emancipation of the American mind from the thraldom of the false philosophies,
		the false theologies, and the debasingly narrow conceptions
		of science which have been transplanted into American colleges. When
		the strong American intellect shall realize that in the science of man
		and in the cultivation of psychometry there is more of enlightenment,
		of wisdom, and of actual knowledge than in all that colleges cherish
		to-day, we shall have such a flood of original thought and immensely
		valuable knowledge as would seem impossible to the literati who now
		have the public ear.</p>

		<p>Even the narrowest dogmatists of science are beginning to have a
		glimpse of the nobler knowledge of the future. Prof. Huxley, the
		most dogmatic of British sceptics, has recently said:</p>

		<p>“The growth of science, not merely of physical science, but of all
		science, means the demonstration of order and natural causation
		among phenomena which had not previously been brought under
		those conceptions. Nobody who is acquainted with the progress of
		scientific thinking in every department of human knowledge, in the
		course of the last two centuries, will be disposed to deny that
		immense provinces have been added to the realm of science, or to
		doubt that the next two centuries will be witnesses of a vastly
		greater annexation. More particularly in the region of the physiology
		of the nervous system is it justifiable to conclude from the progress
		that has been made in analyzing the relations between material
		<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>and psychical phenomena that vast further advances will be made,
		and that sooner or later all the so-called spontaneous operations of
		the mind will have, not only their relations to one another, but their
		relations to physical phenomena, connected in natural series of
		causes and effects, strictly defined. In other words, while at present
		we know only the nearer moiety of the chain of causes and effects by
		which the phenomena we call material give rise to those which we
		call mental, hereafter we shall get to the further end of the series.”</p>

		<p>The “further end of the series,” however, is vastly different from
		anything within the mental range of the distinguished professor,
		whose ultra materialism led him to revamp the old Cartesian doctrine
		that animals were only machines, like clocks or mills, running
		automatically, and destitute of sensation, and intelligence.</p>

		<p>The science and philosophy of the future will be distinguished by
		their mastery of the realm of mind, and the closer approximation of
		the human to the Divine, not only in intelligence, but in ethics.</p>

		<p>The <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>, as the first periodical organ of the new
		philosophy, will attempt gradually to initiate the archetypal forms of
		thought of the coming period, in which the disappearance of old
		philosophy and ethics shall leave room for growth.</p>

		<p>Not that all ethics shall be changed among the civilized races, for
		there are simple primary and true conceptions which are universally
		recognized, and are embalmed in all religions. Yet these few universal
		ideas are but the rudiments of ethics, and no more constitute
		an ethical system worthy of the name, than the four primary processes
		of arithmetic constitute a system of mathematical science. The
		future is to evolve the true ethics, and therewith the educational
		system that will bring the true ethics into all spheres of human life.</p>

		<p>In all past time there has been no ethical system competent to
		establish a perfectly harmonious social state, and no system of education
		competent to lift society to a <em>higher</em> life. Education as it has
		been brightens life with literature and art, but does not <em>elevate</em> it.
		The same old element of poverty, misery, disease, crime, and insanity
		marches on, hand in hand with the college and the church, as it formerly
		went hand in hand with the hunting and warring barbarians
		of the forest. And the dull, blunted conscience of the time, lulled
		by the softly solemn platitudes of the pulpit and the soulless system
		of education, rebels not against the old social order. In full view of
		the past twenty-five centuries, may we not exclaim with Shakespeare’s
		Macbeth:</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<p>“To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow</p>
			<p>Creeps on this petty pace from day to day,</p>
			<p>To the last syllable of recorded time;</p>
			<p>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>
			<p>The dusty way to death.”</p>
		</div>

		<p>But not to the end of time shall it be. The nineteenth century
		has seen the glimmering dawn of the true civilization. How it
		came, what it is, and what it is destined to realize, the <cite class="name">Journal of
		Man</cite> will attempt to show.</p>

		<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="one">I</abbr>.<br />
		GENERAL PLAN OF THE BRAIN.</h3>

		<p class="chapter_outline">The brain the centre of life—Its organs not distinctly separated—Its
		double functions and degrees of energy—Difficulty of nomenclature,
		chiefly basilar—The pathognomic law—Its application
		to the brain—The four cardinal directions and four divisions, the
		coronal, basilar, anterior, and occipital—Their effects on the
		character and constitution—The method of locating organs—The
		four groups—The law of antagonism—Its certainty and
		necessity—Difficulty of expressing it—Correspondence of the
		English language and the brain—Its limits—Radiating groups
		of organs—Contrasts of development.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> details of cerebral science will be much more easily understood
		if we begin with a comprehensive view of the entire plan of
		the functions and structure.</p>

		<p>The brain is distinguished from all other organs by being the
		source of commands which all other organs obey, and being the
		immediate seat of the soul, which has no knowledge of anything
		occurring in the body, until a message or impression has reached it
		through nervous channels. The compression of all the nerves before
		they enter the cranium and connect with the brain would deprive us
		of all knowledge of the body, and of all sensations or perceptions;
		and the compression of the brain itself would render us totally unconscious,
		as if dead,—incapable of either thought or action.
		Manifestly, therefore, all the powers of the soul are lodged in and
		exercised through the brain; and as all distinct nerve structures
		have essentially different functions, and every different function
		requires a different structure, it is obvious that the vast variety of
		our psychic faculties, intellectual, emotional, sensitive, passional,
		and physiological, requires a corresponding multiplicity in the nervous
		apparatus; and this incalculably great multiplicity we find in
		the brain.</p>

		<p>The crude, mechanical idea that all the organs of the brain should
		be distinctly marked and separated by membranous walls or obvious
		changes of structure, is very unscientific; for even in the spinal
		cord, which is more easily studied, we do not find such separation
		between the widely distinct functions of sensibility and motility.
		Their nerve fibres run together undistinguished, and it is only by
		the study of pathological changes that we have been able to distinguish
		the course of the motor fibres, which to the most careful
		inspection are indistinguishable from the sensitive.</p>

		<p>Moreover, the functions of the brain are not like those of the
		spinal cord, of a widely distinct and opposite character in adjacent
		fibres, but exhibit a gradual variation, like the blending colors of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>the rainbow. The sensitive or psychic individual who touches any
		part of the head and feels an impression of the emotional, intellectual,
		or impulsive function in the subjacent convolution of the brain,
		will find the impression gradually changing as he moves his finger
		along the surface, until, after passing half around the cerebrum, he
		will feel an influence exactly opposite to that with which he started.</p>

		<p>As there are many millions of sensitive persons who are capable
		of receiving these impressions from the brain, we cannot but
		wonder at the unanimous <em>indifference</em> (which some may hereafter
		call stupidity) which hinders the medical profession and scientists
		generally from becoming acquainted with such facts, which I have
		proclaimed and demonstrated until I have grown weary of attempting
		to instruct wilful ignorance. Not only does the nervaura, direct
		from the brain convey such impressions of organic action, but almost
		any substance held for a few moments in contact with any part of
		the head will absorb enough of the local nervaura to convey a distinct
		impression to a sensitive, similar to that derived directly
		from the head.</p>

		<p>Although the organs of the brain are thus distinct, they are not
		distinct like the spokes of a wheel, each totally independent of the
		other and fixed or invariable in its own simple character; for all
		organs have double functions, and a great variety in their degree of
		manifestation.</p>

		<p>The double function is psychic and physiological, or physical.
		When the action of the brain is confined within the cranium, its
		action is purely psychic; but when its influence passes into the
		body, it produces physiological effects. As the brain is the seat of
		the soul, its action is essentially and primarily psychic; but as it is
		the commander of the body, and the source of its spiritual vitality,
		all its conditions or actions affect the body; and hence every organ
		has its dual action, psychic and physiological. Cerebral physiology
		and sarcognomy explain in detail how the brain and the mental
		conditions affect the body; cerebral psychology shows how the
		brain and soul are correlated. The purpose of this treatise is to show
		how the brain is correlated with both soul and body, giving the
		principal attention to the former.</p>

		<p>If cerebral organs all have this double function, it is manifestly
		exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to find any words competent
		to express the double functions, and it will be necessary to adapt
		our nomenclature to expressing the psychic function, leaving the
		physiological to be expressed otherwise. As the basilar organs act
		more directly upon the body, their nomenclature will be more
		suggestive of physiological effects. The organ, for example, of
		alimentiveness or appetite will suggest by its name its relation to
		the stomach.</p>

		<p>The difficulty of arranging a satisfactory nomenclature for a certain
		portion of the brain, in consequence of the varying energy of
		organic action, is very great, and must be met by using the word
		which will express in a general manner the organic tendency, leaving
		to the intelligence of the reader to imagine the variations of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>intensity. In the greatest energy of organic action the opposite
		faculty is entirely overcome, and the conduct becomes abnormal, for
		normal action implies the harmonious co-operation of all parts of the
		brain. Nevertheless, it is in this abnormal or excessive action that
		we get the true, isolated tendency or function in its naked expression.</p>

		<p>For example, if we refer to that portion of the brain near the mastoid
		process, which in its excessive action produces murder,
		we perceive that as murder is an abnormal action, such a term
		is not a suitable name for an organ, as it would convey the impression
		that every human being has a constant murderous impulse, and
		that the faculty is kept inactive when murder is not committed;
		from which we might infer that the human constitution is badly
		planned.</p>

		<p>Still, it is not to be concealed that murderous violence is the
		ultimate result of this organ when unrestrained,—that it is the
		most conspicuous faculty in carnivorous animals, and alas! that it
		has a terrible and at times predominant action in the masculine
		portion of the human race. Throughout the greater part of ancient
		history the murderous violence of this faculty has been as conspicuous
		in the human race as in the wild beasts. Even to-day, after centuries
		of so-called civilization and religion, no man’s life would be
		safe if not protected by policemen; and the civilized nations, with
		a skilful ferocity, devote the major part of their governmental
		revenues to preparations for international homicide as a defence
		against the murderous impulse in their neighbors, and to watching
		or controlling the murderers within their own limits; whose homicidal
		propensities, however, are not restrained from <em>mutual homicide</em>,
		by agreement, in the warlike form of the duel, which is considered a
		proper institution to cultivate a martial spirit and promote the
		efficiency of the army,—ay, and even tolerated in the German
		system of education, provided that life is not actually sacrificed.</p>

		<p>Murder is therefore not an improper term to express the consummate
		energy of this basilar organ, if we at the same time understand
		its gentler manifestations; and Dr. Gall was a faithful student
		of nature when he called this faculty the “carnivorous instinct,
		or disposition to murder,” for that is the way that it exhibits in
		animals, and, unfortunately, in mankind also.</p>

		<p>Yet as an element of character, and an organ in the brain, this
		faculty needs a more general and comprehensive term than murder
		to express its ordinary action. It operates as an impelling and modifying
		influence in our daily life, giving a certain kind of energy to
		physical and mental action, as our fruits have a certain degree of
		sweetness in their juices which is not due to crystals of sugar,
		though if the sweetening element were extracted it would appear
		in that solid form. Thus the violent impulsive energy which
		appears in our vigorous language, emphatic gestures, ultra sentiments,
		and threatening expressions, if it could be isolated from its
		psychic combination, would appear in its isolated purity as an impulse
		to the destruction of life and everything else that stands before
		us.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>Hence the term Destructiveness has been very properly applied
		to this organ by Spurzheim. Yet even this term expresses too
		much for its average daily action, and Violence, Impulsiveness, or
		Vehemence would come nearer to expressing its ordinary manifestation.</p>

		<p>The reader will now perceive that the psychic functions of
		certain organs can seldom be adequately expressed by one word,
		and that three words are required to express fully the moderate,
		the active, and the abnormal manifestations. Fortunately, however,
		this difficulty of nomenclature applies only to that portion of the
		brain which tends to the abnormal. Man’s nobler faculties belonging
		to the upper region of the brain are essentially good and normal.
		The abnormal difficulty does not come into their description.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Its operation is limited to the region lying
		around the ears, the basilar region, the tendency
		of which is to exhaust the spiritual vitality of
		the brain in ministering to the body. This will
		be clearly understood when we understand the
		fundamental law of all cerebral action, the
		law of direction, or</p>

		<h3 style="clear:none;">PATHOGNOMIC LAW.</h3>

		<p>This law is the grandest generalization of
		science that was ever conceived. It is the
		fundamental law of the relations of the two
		worlds, the psychic and the physical. The spiritual and material
		worlds unite in man, in whom the eternal spirit is combined with
		a transitory material body, and the law of their interaction is <em>the law
		of the universe</em>.</p>

		<p>In its application to man, the law is simply this, that all organs
		of the brain act in accordance with their position,—in accordance
		with their <em>pathognomic line</em>, or line of action, which is the line of
		their central fibres, the tendency of which is toward the surface of
		the brain, where they reach the interior of the cranium. It will be
		a sufficient approximation to the mathematical truth if for the
		present we say that the pathognomic line may be indicated by a
		perpendicular to the surface of the cranium where the organ is
		located.</p>

		<p>When we establish the pathognomic line, we establish a perfect
		criterion of the organic action, for the action is always in accordance
		with the line; and this fundamental law gives a key to all psychology,
		and gives it a geometrical simplicity.</p>

		<p>In accordance with this law, the frontal or intellectual organs act
		toward the front, and maintain our relations with that which is
		before us. Acting in that manner, they throw out or expend the
		vital forces, and exhaust the energies which belong to the posterior
		part of the brain and posterior part of the body. The posterior half
		of the brain acts in the opposite direction, and thus draws in,
		acquires, and energizes. The posterior action impels the body to
		advance, as the anterior portion checks our progress and causes us
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>to yield. Hence if we erect a perpendicular from the ear, we shall
		find all the energetic impelling faculties behind it, and all that
		moderates, checks, and enlightens before it. Thus the occipital
		development makes a powerful, domineering, conquering character,
		as the frontal makes a passive, unselfish, yielding one.</p>

		<p>Hence all organs in proportion to their energy are located nearer
		to the posterior region of the brain, and in proportion to their
		delicacy or weakness have a more anterior location.</p>

		<div class="illo_left" style="width:244px;">
			<a href="images/fig2.png"><img src="images/fig2-th.png" width="244" height="322" alt="Profile sketch of a man’s head; a horizontal line just above the ear, a nearly vertical line crosses it above the ear" /></a>
		</div>

		<p>There are four classes of pathognomic lines, as there are four
		aspects of the brain, which may be represented on a plane surface,
		and which are sufficient for this incomplete introductory statement—the
		anterior and posterior—the superior or upward, and the
		inferior or downward. The anterior and posterior
		tendencies may be separated by the
		vertical line through the ear. The superior
		and inferior, or upward and downward, may
		be separated by a nearly horizontal line from
		the forehead backward, which nearly coincides
		with the lateral ventricles that separate
		the superior and inferior convolutions. The
		lateral ventricles (cavities the walls of which
		are in contact,) are the central region of the
		brain around which the convolutions are
		formed. Dividing the brain thus into superior
		and inferior halves, we find that the major
		portion of the superior has an upward line which is fully expressed
		at the upper surface of the brain, while the lower half has downward
		lines which are most fully expressed on the basilar surface of
		the brain, which is covered by the face and neck.</p>

		<p>Intermediate between these coronal and basilar surfaces are
		lateral organs which participate in the upward or downward tendency
		as they approach the highest and lowest surfaces.</p>

		<p>The tendency of the coronal region is upward, that of the basilar
		downward. The latter operates downward upon the body, rousing
		the muscles and viscera to activity, but exhausting the brain and
		the spiritual life. Hence, while they vitalize the body, they are the
		source of all that is sensual, violent, beastly, and criminal,—all that
		degrades human nature,—when they become the controlling power,
		which is an abnormal condition.</p>

		<p>The coronal organs tend upward; they withdraw excitement from
		the body, quiet the muscles, and diminish the energy of the appetites
		and passions, while they originate all noble and lofty impulses.
		Their tendency is toward heaven, toward the highest possible
		condition of humanity, the performance of every duty, the enjoyment
		of happiness and health, the perfection of love and fidelity.
		They make the life on earth resemble the life in heaven, and
		consequently bring us into sympathy with all holy influences. They
		make religion a reality, and produce a character which we cannot
		but admire and love. Their tendency is to draw life upward from
		the body to the head and the upper part of the chest, and thereby
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>to energize the soul, which has its home in the brain, and which is
		the essential seat and source of life, and is in interior connection
		with the infinite source of life. Hence the coronal half of the brain
		is the home of spiritual life, the antagonist of disease, the promoter
		of longevity, by which the harmonious love of the upper world is
		realized on earth, and that divine quality of the soul which frees it
		from disease and death is to a limited extent imparted to the human
		body.</p>

		<p>The excessive action of the basilar region exhausts the brain,
		degrades the soul, and thereby impairing the fountain of life and
		health, introduces disease and death. Gluttony, drunkenness,
		sensuality, passion, and violent exertion are the processes that
		exhaust the soul power. Excessive and prolonged muscular exertion
		without rest exhausts the brain. But the normal action of the
		basilar organs is essential to all the processes of life, and maintains
		the union of soul and body. Hence their good development is
		necessary to longevity.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, excessive predominance of the coronal region,
		although it heightens the spiritual nature, withdraws life from the
		body, and culminates in trance, ending in death by the ascension of
		the soul from the body. But so long as the basilar organs have
		sufficient energy to maintain the connection of the soul with the
		body, the most powerful action of the coronal region increases the
		power of the brain, the brilliance of the mind, the perfection of the
		health, and the moral greatness and power of the person.</p>

		<p>These statements are essentially different from the physiological
		and phrenological ideas heretofore current, but they are sustained
		by universal experience, which recognizes the power of heroism,
		hope, religion, and love to exalt our powers of endurance and
		achievement, whether intellectual or physical; and they are sustained
		by the records of pathology, which show that softening or
		ulceration of the superior regions of the brain impairs, paralyzes, or
		destroys all our powers. Moreover, all that I teach on these subjects
		is but an expression of the formulated results of many thousand
		experiments during the last forty-five years.</p>

		<p>The simplicity and applicability of these pathognomic laws which
		pervade all psychic phenomena are such that they are easily mastered,
		and a single evening devoted to the subject enables my
		students to locate with approximate correctness nearly all the
		organs of the brain. The multiplicity of the cerebral organs is
		somewhat discouraging to a student at first, but all embarrassment
		is removed when the simplicity of the Divine plan is shown.</p>

		<p>In illustrating these principles, we take up a number of faculties
		successively, and determine by their nature what should be their
		latitude and longitude upon the map. Thus, for example, if
		Modesty is mentioned, students would say it should be above the
		horizontal line, but not so high as the virtues, and that it should be
		not among the energies, but among the moderating faculties of the
		front half of the head. Hence they usually ascertain its true location.
		If Avarice or Acquisitiveness should be considered, they
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>would recognize it as entitled to a place below the horizontal line,
		and also behind the vertical line, but neither the lowest nor the most
		posterior. If Firmness is mentioned, they recognize it as entitled to
		a high place, but behind the vertical line; and thus they seldom
		make any great error in determining the location of an organ.</p>

		<div class="illo_left" style="width:305px;">
			<a href="images/fig3.png"><img src="images/fig3-th.png" width="305" height="356" alt="Head with lines and areas marked: Intellect, Virtue, Social Energy, Animal Force, Sensibility &amp; Excitablility." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>If we thus go through the catalogue of psychic powers or qualities,
		we observe finally that the organs are grouped as follows; and this
		grouping should be impressed upon the
		memory, as it is easily learned, and serves
		as a basis for the further study of organology.
		The organs in this drawing are
		not arranged to show their antagonism,
		but antagonism is the most important
		fundamental principle of cerebral psychology.</p>

		<h3 style="clear:none;">THE LAW OF ANTAGONISM.</h3>

		<p>Antagonism or opposition is the universal
		condition of all that we know.
		Up suggests down; inward, outward;
		forward, backward; advance, recession;
		motion, rest; elevation, degradation; abundance, deficiency; heat, cold;
		light, darkness; strength, weakness. The same antagonism exists in
		the psychic nature, as in love, hate; hope, despair; courage, cowardice;
		pride, humility, etc.; and equally in the physiological, as we see in
		the action of flexor and extensor muscles, their antagonism being a
		necessity. If we had only flexor muscles, one motion would exhaust
		the muscular capacity; when the limb is flexed it can do nothing
		more; but when the extensor muscle moves it back, flexion can be
		again performed. Thus all vital voluntary action is a play of opposing
		forces,—the existence of one force rendering possible the
		existence of its opposite. The coronal organs, carrying the soul
		above the body, would bring the end of terrestrial life, and the
		basilar organs exhausting the brain would bring to a more disastrous
		end; but the joint action of the two, like that of flexor and extensor
		muscles, produces the infinite variety of life, which moves on like
		pendulums, in continual alternation.</p>

		<p>Man would be utterly unfit for the sphere that he occupies, if he
		had not the opposite capacities required by innumerable opposite
		conditions. Physiologically, he requires calorific powers to fit him
		for cold climates, and cooling capacities to fit him for the torrid
		zone. Morally, he requires warlike powers to meet enemies and
		dangers, as well as affections for the sphere of domestic love. He
		requires the conscious intellect to call forth and guide his powers in
		exertion, and a faculty for repose and recuperation in sleep. He
		requires self respect to sustain him in elevated positions, and humility
		to fit him for humble duties and positions. We can conceive no
		faculty which has not its opposite,—no faculty which would not
		terminate its own operation, like a flexor muscle, if there were no
		antagonist. Benevolence would exhaust the purse and be unable to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>give, if Acquisitiveness did not replenish it; and Avarice unrestrained
		would lose all financial capacity in the sordid stupidity of
		the miser. Each faculty alone, without its antagonist, carries us to
		a helpless extreme.</p>

		<p>The antagonism of faculties is so self evident a law of nature that
		if Dr. Gall had pre-arranged a psychic philosophy in his mind, instead
		of being a simple observer of facts, he might have given a very
		different aspect to the science. But he arranged no psychic
		philosophy, and he did not carry his observations far enough to lead
		him into the law of antagonism, and hence left a rude system, lacking
		in the symmetry and completeness necessary to give it the
		position of a complete philosophy.</p>

		<p>But while the law of antagonism should control our psychic
		studies, it is not always convenient to express this antagonism in our
		nomenclature, or to group the functions of all regions of the brain in
		such a manner that each group or organ shall exactly correspond to
		an antagonism in another organ; for in expressing the functions of
		parts of the brain we are limited by the structure of the English
		language, and have to make such groups as will be conveniently
		expressed by familiar English words,—the words of a language
		that has grown up in a confused manner, and was not organized to
		express the faculties of sub-divisions of the brain. Hence, for want
		of a pre-arranged language, with words of accurate definition and
		exact antagonism, we can only approximate a perfect nomenclature,
		and must rely more upon description than upon classification and
		technical terms.</p>

		<p>Technicality, however, is to be avoided as far as possible.
		Anthropology may need, like other new sciences, new terms for its
		new ideas, but the old words of plain English express all the very
		important elements of human nature. To the master of anthropology
		it is easy to take any word expressive of an element of
		human character or capacity and show from what convolution,
		what group of convolutions, or what part of a convolution the quality
		or faculty arises which that word expresses. An evening might
		be profitably spent with a class of students in tracing English words
		to their cerebral source.</p>

		<p>In expressing the functions of the brain by nomenclature, we are
		entering upon an illimitable science, and must hold back to keep
		within the limits of the practicable and useful. The innumerable
		millions of fibres and ganglion globules in the brain are beyond
		calculation, and their varieties of function are beyond all descriptive
		power. Geography does not attempt to describe every square mile
		of the earth’s surface, nor does astronomy presume to know all the
		stars. In reference to the brain, psychic students will hereafter
		send forth ponderous volumes of descriptive detail, for which there
		is no demand at present. I willingly resign that task to my successors.
		A description which portrays the general character of an
		inch of convolution, or of a half inch square of the finer intellectual
		organs, is sufficiently minute for the purposes of a student. Acting
		upon these views, the following catalogue of psychic functions has
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>been prepared, which is offered now not for the reader’s study, as
		the multiplicity of detail would be embarrassing, but merely to give
		a general conception of the scope of cerebral psychology, and to
		show how extensive and apparently intricate a system may, by
		proper explanation of its principles,
		be made intelligible to
		all.</p>

		<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>Superficial Criticism.</h2>

		<p class="subtitle">A RESPONSE TO MISS ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS.</p>

		<p class="purpose"><span class="first_word">The</span> publication in the Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite> of two columns of sharp
		criticism on the spiritual movement by Miss Phelps, which were
		widely republished, induced the editor to send the following
		reply to the <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, which was duly published.</p>

		<p class="dateline"><span class="name">Boston, Mass.</span>, Jan. 23.</p>

		<p>The rhetorically eloquent essay of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps on
		spiritualism has been read by the undersigned with that peculiar
		pleasure with which we witness an intellectual or psychic <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de
		force</em> which produces singular results. It is quite an able production,
		for the ability of an advocate is measured by his capacity to
		make that which is obviously absurd appear quite rational, and to
		give to that which is intrinsically small or mean an air of refined
		dignity. Divested of its dignified and delusive rhetoric, what does
		the lady say or mean in plain, homely English?</p>

		<p>She says that “cultivated thought” has a “slippery surface” on
		which spiritualism has made “a clutch,” and that it has lately made
		an “encroachment upon scientific attention,” so that psychical
		societies of distinguished men are “busying themselves;” also that
		spiritualism must be “made subject to the laws of common sense”
		and controlled by “common integrity,” and if this truth “is at last
		materializing before the consciousness of the believers in spiritualistic
		phenomena some good may come of it.”</p>

		<p>That a certain style of “cultivated thought” familiar in Boston
		has a “slippery surface” on which neither religion nor philosophy
		makes much impression, cannot be denied, and that it is only lately (as
		she says) that psychical societies of more or less distinguished men
		have allowed spiritual science to encroach on their attention, is very
		true. It has always been so. Societies of distinguished men have
		always been behind the progress of undistinguished men. Neither
		Harvey nor Galvani was honored by societies of distinguished men
		until the “slippery surface” of their “cultivated thought” was
		clutched and crushed by the power of a widely diffused truth. As
		a general rule, the last place in which to find the foremost thought
		of the age is in the societies of distinguished men, whether they be
		politicians, theologians, or scientists. Hence it is that phenomena
		as old as history itself and of late as thoroughly investigated as any
		branch of positive science have just begun to encroach upon the attention
		of the societies to which the lady desires us to surrender our judgment.
		No doubt they have resisted such encroachments as long as
		decency would permit, and some very able writers think a great deal
		longer.</p>

		<p>As to the insinuation that “believers in spiritualistic phenomena
		have only of late begun to appreciate common sense and common
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>honesty,” when these believers count by millions, and include many
		more eminent men than her infallible psychic societies, the lady has
		permission to withdraw the charge, for it is obviously only the
		<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapsus linguæ</em> of a too fluent tongue.</p>

		<p>Again she says: “Which of us would not lay down life itself to
		know that he had spoken yesterday with the darling of our souls
		dead years ago?” Not one of you! The expression is rather
		hysterical in its intensity. The majority of your ultra-sceptical
		class would not even spend a day or an hour in the pursuit, for you
		have neglected the opportunities which have been open to all the
		world. You might have held a pair of slates in your own hands,
		secured in any manner, with no pencil between them; might have
		heard the writing in progress, then opened them and recognized the
		message of your own darling—perhaps the handwriting also. Thousands
		of modest, honest seekers of truth have done these things.
		But the Pharisees who talk of heaven and then fly from its approach
		have “religiously shunned” them; that is the way they express it,
		and you are their apologist. But what is your apology?</p>

		<p>You give a graphic description of a cheap style of dishonest
		mediumship with vulgar surroundings, in which, nevertheless, there
		are wonderful revelations, “the golden thread of a truth that is
		worth having,” and you suggest that the truth must now be “garnered”
		by a psychical research society, intimating that if they do
		not garner it, it will cease to be recognized as truth, and that the
		mediums must bring it all to them for sanction, or cease to be
		respected by honorable people. Was ever a more unfair and delusive
		statement made by a hired attorney? The grandeur of the
		theme has not inspired a spirit of fairness or justice. The question
		lies between the eternal and holy verities of spiritual science or
		religious science and the conscience of the inquirer. The poor,
		illiterate, and obscure people who exhibit for a living whatever
		capacity they may have, have nothing to do with it. Would our
		lady critic select a cheap sign painter to represent the beauty and
		glory of art, or the exhibitors of laughing gas to illustrate the
		science of Sir Humphrey Davy, or the performances of an illiterate
		quack to illustrate the dignity of the medical profession? Is our
		critic so profoundly ignorant of the progress of psychic science as to
		think such representations fair or allowable?</p>

		<p>A science is represented by its leaders, its authors, its teachers,
		not its camp followers. Examine the writings of Alfred Russell
		Wallace, Professor Crookes of London, Epes Sargent, William
		Howitt, Professor Hare—of Swedenborg, Kerner, Ennemoser, Du
		Prel, Hellenbach, Fichte, Varley, Ashburner, Flammarion, Aksakoff,
		and a score of others of the highest rank, and criticize if you can the
		magnificent philosophy of these and of many an ancient writer.
		Consider the well attested facts and sublime religion that you will
		find in them, and observe that the facts are a hundred times better
		attested and a thousand times more critically observed than any of
		those upon which the world’s great religions rest, before which our
		critic reverently bows.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>[<strong class="headline">Note.</strong>—Rev. Henry Ward Beecher is reported to have said in
		1860: “The physiology, the anthropology of the Bible, is highly
		odic, and must be studied as such. As such it will be found to
		harmonize with the general principles of human experience in such
		matters in all ages. If a theory be adopted everywhere else but
		in the Bible, excluding spiritual intervention <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</em>, and accounting
		for everything physically, then will the covers of the Bible prove
		but pasteboard barriers. Such a theory will sweep its way through
		the Bible and its authority, and its inspirations will be annihilated.
		On the other hand, if the theory of spiritual intervention be accepted
		in the Bible, it cannot be shut up there, but must sweep its way
		through the wide domain of ‘popular superstitions,’ as they are
		called, separating the element of truth on which they are based, and
		asserting its own authoritative supremacy.”]</p>

		<p>Then if you must for a partisan purpose ignore all this, and select
		obscure people to represent the other side of the question, it would
		be very easy to find mediumship of a pure and honorable character—mediums
		whom no one visits without carrying away a sweet,
		refining influence, a stronger faith, and a brighter realization of
		heavenly truths. And there are mediums, too, from whose lips distil
		a lofty eloquence and a remarkable wisdom upon any or all
		subjects proposed, with a flow of extemporaneous poetry or of
		heavenly music which has never been equaled under such circumstances
		by uninspired mortals.</p>

		<p>But, forsooth, they must come to a psychic society that the world
		may learn from their papal infallibility if anything exists at all
		worthy of notice. This is indeed seriously proposed! Well, if a
		group of clergymen in synod assembled should summon all geologists
		and astronomers to come before them and show if there was
		anything in their scientific teachings, their heretical, astronomical,
		and geological doctrines, would any one have responded to the presumptuous
		demand? Would Airy, Lyell, Miller, Darwin, or the
		poorest country school master have taken any notice of such a
		demand?</p>

		<p>The majority of the American Psychical Research Society know
		vastly less of psychic science than clergymen know of geology and
		astronomy. They have been not inquirers, but obstructionists, assailing
		those who dare to inquire, and the subject, as their friend says,
		has only lately encroached on their attention. The admirable scientific
		experiments of Professor Hare and Professor Crookes have long
		since settled the questions which they now propose to take up, and
		when, over forty years ago, I published in my <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>
		the incontestable facts then established, and gave their rationale,
		the psychic researchers of to-day were as ignorant as sucking babes of
		the whole subject. This ignorance is the very <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’etre</em> of the
		society. They don’t know if there is anything to be discovered, and
		they propose to look out. Their failure so far is considered by
		Colonel Higginson a proof of their superior wisdom, which means that
		they are looking for a mare’s nest, and have shown their wisdom
		by not finding it!</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>Let those who are seeking to enter the freshman class in psychic
		science assume a little appearance of modesty, and not attempt to
		set themselves above the old graduates and professors of the university,
		at which they have heretofore been throwing stones like an
		unrestrained mob. This is plain speech, but it is just. Let them
		begin their operations by an act of justice—by building a monument
		to Professor Hare, the noblest of American scientists, and the
		object of their persecution.</p>

		<p>“The time has come,” says our lady critic, “for mystery to work
		hand in hand with scientific study or to lay aside its claims to
		scientific respect.” Very true, very true, indeed, except your chronology;
		the time has long since gone by. Science has grappled with
		mystery long since. I can point out, if you wish to see it, the very
		anatomical structures, the special fibres in connection with which
		the spiritual phenomena are developed. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</em> is
		understood, and the facts have been known some thirty, some a hundred,
		some several thousand years. Among advanced thinkers
		psychic science is no more a debatable question than the rotundity
		of the earth or the principles of astronomy.</p>

		<p>Finally, dear, eloquent lady, your exhortations in behalf of honesty
		are very admirable, indeed, and would be much more admirable if
		the exhortation itself were more fair and honest—if you did not
		seem to sprinkle the reproach of dishonesty over multitudes of
		honest people more gifted than yourself, with the power to find and
		clasp the holiest truths. If the inferior and less honorable class of
		mediums are now before the public, why is it? It is due solely,
		dear lady, to such people as yourself and your psychic society men,
		and “fellows of a baser sort,” who follow your lead—to those whose
		censorious and sometimes scurrilous hostility against spiritual phenomena
		has driven into retirement or kept in concealment the
		most beautiful and holy phenomena that were ever known on earth.
		Angels do not confront the hissing mob. But their visits to-day are
		neither few nor far between. In every bower of perfect spiritual
		purity they come. Let but this brutal opposition of men and fluent
		scorn of women cease, and the universal air will be fragrant as the
		spiritual beauty now hidden shall become a part of our social life,
		and even the fastidious Miss Phelps will be satisfied and delighted.</p>

		<p>[<strong class="headline">Note.</strong>—Miss Phelps, if she had due respect for her grandfather,
		the Rev. Dr. Phelps of Stratford, Conn., ought to be an earnest
		champion of spiritualism, for it was at his house that the most wonderful
		phenomena were realized, when invisible spirits carried on their
		pranks with the furniture like human beings. Dr. Phelps was a
		thorough spiritualist, and introduced the spiritual doctrine into his
		sermons, though exercising the worldly wisdom of not using the
		word <em>spiritualism</em>.]</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Abram James—Man and Medium.</h3>

		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> was in the summer of 1863 that I first met this marvelous
		medium, one of the very best in the way of intellectual development
		that I ever saw. James was born in Pennsylvania, of Quaker
		parentage. He inherited the simplicity, candor, and truthfulness of
		the sect. He had absolutely no guile in his nature. He had had
		but six months’ common school education, but, possessing considerable
		natural ability, he had to some degree remedied his deficiencies
		in this particular. He wrote a fair hand, spelled well and conversed
		with some facility on ordinary topics, but was absolutely ignorant
		of any language but his native English, and had no knowledge whatever
		of scientific subjects; this I know to be a fact. James was
		above the medium height, very thin and spare, blonde complexion,
		light hair and blue eyes—a natural negative organization. When I
		first made his acquaintance he was employed in the yards of one of
		the railroad companies in Chicago, making up trains, or some employment
		of that character.</p>

		<p>Of James’s original development as a medium I know nothing, as
		I first knew him in his abnormal character, in which he was truly
		marvelous, being perfectly familiar with all languages, living and
		dead, and with all subjects—religion, science, philosophy, and ethics.</p>

		<p>I have heard this man speak and deliver long discourses in German,
		Spanish, Italian, French, Latin, Greek, and other tongues which
		I did not know. I have taken scholarly linguists in his presence
		and to them he demonstrated that he spoke in foreign tongues.</p>

		<p>I have heard him deliver lectures on a great variety of scientific
		subjects,—on political economy, theology, and natural philosophy.
		His thought and method of treatment were of the very highest types
		of intellectual ability. Of course James did not profess to do this of
		himself; he was in fact, wholly unconscious of doing anything.
		When entranced, the controlling spirit would say, for example:
		“The Baron von Humboldt will address you this afternoon on the
		Cosmos.” Then in a discourse or lecture of an hour’s duration he
		would give a condensed history of the origin and development of the
		world. I remember on one occasion he took up the nebular or La
		Place theory, adopted it as the true one, and traced the rise and
		progress of the earth through the evolution of matter to its present
		condition, in a most comprehensive and masterly manner. At
		another time it was said: “John Quincy Adams will speak to you
		to-day on the political condition of your country,” and with all the
		grace, dignity, and eloquence of the famous old Senator from Massachusetts
		when addressing the Senate of the United States, this
		medium delivered a speech of which Adams himself would not have
		been ashamed. It was in the war times, and fully embodied the
		sentiments which we know were predominant in Mr. Adams’s mind—the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>permanency of the Union and liberty for the slave. It was
		before the emancipation proclamation, but the speaker assured his
		hearers that the day was close at hand when the oppressed and
		abused slave should walk out in freedom before all the world.</p>

		<p>I remember one very remarkable occurrence. James was entranced
		by the spirit of Michael Angelo, and a lady medium present
		was controlled by Raphael, and these two, partly in Italian and
		partly in English, discoursed upon art, painting, architecture, and
		sculpture in a manner calculated to produce a lasting impression
		upon the minds of those who were so fortunate as to be witnesses of
		the scene. The spirits were evidently fearful of losing control of the
		medium, and in their hasty desire to speak constantly interrupted
		each other, but they referred to the great works in which they had
		been engaged while on the earth, and the monuments they had left
		behind them. I remember Raphael particularly speaking of his
		last great painting of the Transfiguration, which he declared he had
		left in an unfinished condition in Rome, and which he desired to
		complete if he only had the opportunity. I regret that I am not able
		at this distant time to give full details of these, their marvelous
		revelations. I had shorthand notes taken which were afterwards
		written out, but unfortunately they were all destroyed in the great
		Chicago fire, in 1871.</p>

		<p>James was also a drawing medium, and as such he executed many
		fine pictures. His method of work in this direction was quite
		beyond the capacity of any human being. He operated with six
		pencils, three in each hand, each pencil doing a separate part of the
		work at the same time; the consequent rapidity of execution was
		something wonderful. James once drew a colossal picture of Lincoln,
		which measured seven and one half feet in length. The sheet
		of paper was laid upon the floor, and upon it, without any outline
		or measurements, he first made an eye, and then in its proper relative
		position a boot. When the outlines were completed, these
		came into their proper places. The picture was a fair likeness of
		Lincoln, and represented him in the act of reading the emancipation
		proclamation. The pictorial heading of your paper, with its name
		in the letters as they now stand, <cite class="name">Religio-Philosophical Journal</cite>,
		all finished and complete as it is, was done by James in the manner
		above stated. The engraver who reproduced it has not altered one
		line or mark; yet this man in his natural condition could not draw
		the outline of a barn.</p>

		<p>James located the first artesian well which was bored in Chicago.
		He declared by his clairvoyant sight that a stream of water could
		be found many hundreds of feet beneath the surface. The boring
		was done and the water found, and this well was the originator of
		the numerous other wells which now supply our parks and factories.
		James afterward went to the oil regions of Pennsylvania, where he
		was successful in locating productive oil wells. Since 1869, I have
		lost sight of him, but wherever he may be he is a marvelous, intellectual
		medium, and as honest and truthful as the sunlight.</p>

			following occurred. They are not extraordinary to those familiar
			with spiritual facts. I have held a slate in my own hand in the
			presence of a medium, and received messages on the slate in which
			every letter was written in double marks, as if written with two
			different colored pencils, although <em>no pencil was furnished</em> or seen.</p>

			<p>“Three small pieces of writing-pencil—green, red, and white—were
			put upon the perfectly clean school slate, and placed under the
			table as before, with this difference: that G.’s left hand held the slate
			with Mr. Eglinton, his left being above the table. The slate was
			now thoroughly rolled about so as to completely displace the pieces
			of pencil from their previous relations. G. asked aloud that 200
			might be put down in <em>red</em>; I called for 69 in <em>green</em>; and Mr.
			Eglinton requested that they be added up in <em>white</em>. Upon examining
			the slate, this was found correctly executed. I then took a
			book at random from a case containing perhaps 300 or 400 volumes.
			G. wrote down upon the school slate the number of a page, a line,
			and of a word, which she desired to be transcribed. The slate was
			turned over, and I placed the book, which had not been opened,
			across it, resting upon the frame. Under the book I placed a morsel
			of pencil. The slate, with the book upon it, was then passed under
			and pressed against the table-top as before. No one but G. was
			cognizant of what she had written, and, of course, as the book was
			never out of my possession from the time I took it from its fellows
			in the case until it was placed with the slate under the table-top,
			there was no possibility of its pages being scanned. The sound of
			writing soon occurred, and upon its ceasing we examined the slate,
			when we found ‘P. 7, L. 18, W. 6, Llanwrst.’ The other side of
			the slate contained ‘P. 7, L. 18, W. 6,’ as written by G. I now
			and for the first time opened the book, which was ‘The Irish Educational
			Guide and Scholastic Directory,’ for 1883 and 1884,
			published by John Mara, 17 Crow Street, Dublin; and upon turning

			<p><strong class="headline">Spirit Writing.</strong>—The world is full of spiritual phenomena

			<p>“I have known of a great many astonishing things that I can

			I know a lady—a church member—who makes no pretensions as
			a fortune teller, clairvoyant, or medium, and who would indignantly
			resent being called a Spiritualist. This lady takes a pencil in her
			hand and writes rapidly and legibly, with her arm extended, without
			looking at the paper or pencil, and gazing in an opposite direction
			from the work. And this is done in a way that shows no control of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>her arms in the operation. She writes answers to questions she
			could not possibly have any knowledge of in a correct and thoroughly
			truthful way. Even when she is separated from the questioner
			by a closed door she readily writes out the correct answer to
			a mental question with no effort of her own. This woman could
			not be induced to do so for any compensation. I have seen all the

		<h2 class="title">Mind-Reading Amusement.</h2>

		<p class="salutation">To the Editor of the Transcript:</p>

		<p>This amusement may possibly help to attract the indifferent
		public toward the higher branches of science, which are so much
		neglected. Probably not one in a thousand of those who are
		attracted to this subject by curiosity has given any attention to
		that department of science to which mind-reading belongs.</p>

		<p>Americans are not distinguished for reverence. They often rush
		into the consideration and discussion of subjects with which they
		have no familiarity, without pausing to learn whether any investigations
		have already been made. In matters of mechanical invention
		attempts are continually making to achieve what investigation
		has proved impossible, and a great deal of labor and money are
		wasted in finding by costly experience what is already known, and
		might have been learned by an hour’s attention to recorded science.</p>

		<p>The dabbler in science and invention often fancies himself a discoverer,
		asserts his claims, and receives recognition from those who
		are still more ignorant of the subject than himself. Under this head
		come the performances of Mr. Bishop and other sciolists who are
		exercising similar powers with similar success.</p>

		<p>“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” said Pope; for the sciolist
		is continually blundering in the false and superficial theories
		which belong to the first stage of investigation, through which the
		patient student of nature has made his way to a full understanding
		of the subject.</p>

		<p>The sympathetic transference of thought from one mind to
		another, and the acquisition of knowledge of things either present
		or remote, without the aid of the external senses, are phenomena
		known as far back as history has any records. Such phenomena are
		wonderful and mysterious, but not more so than the generation of
		animal life or the appearance of a rainbow in the sky—subjects from
		which science has removed much of the mystery.</p>

		<p>Trans-corporeal or non-sensual perception has also been investigated,
		its laws established, its anatomical and physiological foundation
		explained, its range of power determined, its vast powers and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>utilities illustrated, and its method of development and culture made
		known. But of all this the mind-reading sciolists know nothing
		and have not attempted to learn anything. They are attitudinizing
		on the outer steps of the temple of science, before the gazing multitude,
		instead of penetrating the interior of the temple, where the
		multitude do not follow.</p>

		<p>The exhibiting mind-readers start with the assumption that matter
		does all, and that the ample literature in which the powers of
		the soul are recorded, demonstrated, and explained is unworthy of
		notice. Thus they place themselves in sympathy with the prevalent
		ignorance on such subjects, and the dogmatism of a certain class of
		scientists.</p>

		<p>The dogmatism of this hypothesis cannot be maintained by any
		careful and conscientious inquirer, who knows how to conduct an
		investigation. When the psychic faculties are well developed, as
		they certainly are in Mr. Bishop, the inquirer cannot fail to realize
		that ideas are developed by transference in the mind without the
		slightest opportunity of being instructed by muscular movements.
		Hence Mr. Bishop finally admits the direct transference of thought
		from mind to mind; but instead of presenting it boldly as a positive
		and thousand times demonstrated act, he still leans upon the letter
		of Dr. Carpenter, which represents him as learning the thoughts of
		others, by “careful study of the indications unconsciously given by
		the subject.”</p>

		<p>He confesses that he once stood upon the strictly material hypothesis,
		from which he has advanced to the psychic doctrine he now
		maintains, and adds, “Where I am may be only a stopping, not an
		abiding, place.” Very true; the remark is honorable to his candor.
		He should advance a great deal farther; but he would not have
		stopped at either position if he had taken pains to learn what was
		already known and published a quarter of a century, or even what
		was known several centuries, before he began.</p>

		<p>If he would even now read Professor Gregory’s “Letters on
		Animal Magnetism” and the “Manual of Psychometry,” published
		in Boston, he might make a new departure, might understand the
		vast extent of his own powers, which he has not yet developed, and
		show to those whom he has already astonished that there is much
		more in the mysteries of earth and heaven than their mechanical
		philosophy has even suspected.</p>

		<p>“Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring,” was the suggestion
		of Pope; and if Mr. Bishop or any of those who have been sipping at
		this fountain of knowledge would call upon me (at 6 James Street,
		Franklin Square) I would take pleasure in showing them the unsuspected
		extent of their own powers, and showing how thoroughly the
		questions they are interested in were investigated over forty years ago,
		to scatter the mystery and bring the wonderful and almost incredible
		powers of the mind into correlation with biology and anatomy.</p>

		<p>I might show them, too, that mind-readers are not such extraordinary
		persons as they are commonly supposed. There are many
		millions in the world who can exercise the class of faculties to which
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>mind-reading belongs—a class of faculties long neglected by superficial
		scientists, from the cultivation of which more may be expected
		for the future intellectual progress of mankind than from anything
		else now known to the universities.</p>

		<p>I mean no disrespect in styling Mr. Bishop a sciolist (or undeveloped
		scientist). That very sciolism brought him into sympathy with Dr.
		Carpenter and other distinguished gentlemen who would not have
		listened to him if he had come in any nobler manner, and enabled
		him to open their eyes. Perhaps if he will take another step in
		advance he can lead the majority of his pupils to a higher position,
		and thus render a signal service to society. I hope he will have the
		candor and courage to advance far beyond his present position.</p>

		<p>Since Mr. Bishop’s exhibitions have been so successful and profitable,
		several others have repeated his performances of telling the
		number of a bank note, finding hidden articles, and going through
		any performance that was enacted during his absence from the hall.
		Mr. Montague, an editor of the <cite>Globe</cite>, Mr. George, Mr. Wilder, and
		several others have shown the same powers. A dispatch from St.
		John, New Brunswick, to the <cite>Herald</cite> describes a remarkable performance
		at that place as follows:</p>

		<p>“<strong class="name">St. John, N. B.</strong>, Jan. 17, 1887. In a ‘mind reading’ performance
		Saturday night, after several examples indoors, the ‘reader,’
		a young man who belongs to this city, asked for an outdoor test.
		The party separated, one remaining with the reader, and hid a pin
		in the side of a little house used by the switchman of the New
		Brunswick railway at Mill Street. In their travels they went over
		the new railway trestle, a most difficult journey. The reader
		was blindfolded, and one took his wrist, but at the trestle hesitated,
		fearing to venture, and was told by the reader to let go his wrist
		and place his hand on his head. The subject did so, and the reader
		went upon the trestle. Some of the party suggested that the bandage
		should be removed, but he told them not to mind, and, the
		subject again taking his wrist, he went on over the icy and snow-covered
		sleepers. With a firm step he crossed to the long wharf,
		went over as far as the mill gates, then quickly turned, retraced his
		steps and went back to the corner of Mill Street. Here he rested a
		moment, then again took the subject’s hand, and in less than five
		minutes afterward found the pin. At the conclusion of the test,
		the reader inquired what the matter had been when they first
		reached the trestle. It was easily explained. The storm had covered
		the sleepers with snow, and it was thought dangerous even for
		a man not blindfolded to cross them. The subject felt anxious for
		the reader’s safety, and hesitated about going across. The tests
		were most satisfactory.”</p>

			<p><strong class="headline">Pigmies.</strong>—A while ago, says the <cite>Sun</cite>, Mr. Grenfell of the Congo
			Mission encountered on the Bosari River, south of the Congo, the
			Batwa dwarfs whom Stanley mentions in “The Dark Continent,”
			though Stanley did not see them. Grenfell says these little people
			exist over a large extent of country, their villages being scattered
			here and there among other tribes. Wissmann and Pogge also met
			them a few years ago in their journey to Nyangwe.</p>

			<p>It was long supposed that the story of Herodotus about the pigmies
			of Africa was mythical, but within the past twenty years abundant
			evidence has accumulated of the existence of a number of tribes of
			curious little folks in equatorial Africa. The chief among these
			tribes are the Akka, whom Schweinfurth found northwest of Albert
			Nyassa; the Obongo, discovered by DuChaillu in west Africa,
			southwest of Gaboon; and the Batwa, south of Congo.</p>

			<p>These little people range in height from 4 feet 2 inches to about
			4 feet 8 inches. They are intellectually as well as physically inferior
			to the other tribes of Africa. They are perhaps nearer the brute
			kingdom than any other human beings. The Obongo, for instance,
			wear no semblance of clothing: make no huts except to bend over
			and fasten to the ground the tops of three or four young trees,
			which they cover with leaves; possess no arts except the making of
			bows and arrows, and do not till the soil. They live on the smaller
			game of the forest and on nuts and berries. They regard the
			leopard, which now and then makes a meal of one of them, as their
			deadliest enemy. They live only a few days or weeks in one place.</p>

			<p>When Schweinfurth first met the Akka dwarfs he found himself
			surrounded by what he supposed was a crowd of impudent boys.
			There were several hundred of them, and he soon found that they
			were veritable dwarfs, and that their tribe probably numbered
			several thousand souls. One of these dwarfs was taken to Italy a
			few years ago, was taught to read, and excited much interest among
			scientific men. There are other tribes of dwarfs in Abyssinia and
			also in Somaliland.</p>

			<p>It is believed that all these people, including the Bushmen of
			South Africa, are the remains of an aboriginal population that is
			now becoming extinct. In the migrations and subjugations that
			have been in progress for many centuries among powerful tribes, the
			dwarf tribe of Africa has been scattered, and its isolated fragments
			are still found in widely separated parts of the continent.</p>

			<p><strong class="headline">A Human Phenomenon.</strong>—M. de Quatrefages, the naturalist,

			thanks to his peculiar system of muscles and nerves, can transform
			himself in most wondrous fashion. He has very properly dubbed
			himself “L’Homme-Protee.” At one moment, assuming the rigidity

			a cage, and the hollow look of his body immediately reminds one of
			a skeleton. Aiguier successfully imitates a man subjected to the
			tortures of the rack, as also a man hanging himself, and assumes a
			strikingly cadaveric look. What most astonished M. de Quatrefages
			was the stoppage of the circulation of the blood, now on the

			<p><strong class="headline">Surviving Superstitions.</strong>—The once flourishing and wealthy
			colony of German Rappites, or Harmonists, who sold out New
			Harmony, Indiana, to old Robert Owen sixty years ago, (where
			Owen’s grand fiasco occurred,) and removed to Economy, Pa., held
			their annual festival on the 15th of February in the usual solemn
			manner. Father Rapp is dead long ago, and of the thousand
			energetic religious and industrious enthusiasts who have been so
			prosperous in worldly matters, scarcely fifty remain as feeble old
			men, and their pastor, Father Henrici, is over 83 years old; but the
			honest and worthy old enthusiasts are still waiting for the personal

			dies out, establish his kingdom with his throne on Mount Sinai, and
			judge and rule the world. They believe that their beloved Father
			Henrici will never die, but will lead them to the presence of their
			Divine Master on Mount Sinai; and he proposes to lead them to
			Palestine, when they have signs of the Lord’s approach, that they
			may be ready to meet him.</p>

			<p>There is a solemn beauty and grandeur in these weird old superstitions

			<p><strong class="headline">Religious Mediævalism in America.</strong>—Twelve miles from

			<p><strong class="headline">Craniology and Crime.</strong>—The <cite>British Medical Journal</cite> presents
			at some length the results arrived at by Prof. Benedict, in his examination
			of the brains of criminals—some sixteen in all. Every one
			of these, in comparison with the healthy brain, proved to be abnormal.
			Not only, too, has he found that these brains deviate from
			the normal type, and approach that of lower animals, but he has
			been able to classify them, and with them the skulls in which they
			were contained, in three categories.</p>

			<p>First, absence of symmetry between the two halves of the brain;
			Second, an obliquity of the interior part of the brain or
			skull—in fact, a continuation upward of what is usually termed
			a sloping forehead; third, a distinct lessening of the posterior
			cerebral lobes, so that, as in the lower animals, they are not large
			enough to hide the cerebellum. In all these peculiarities, the
			criminal’s brain and skull are distinctly of a lower type than those
			of normal men.</p>

			<p>That a diminution of the posterior lobes should be recognized as

		<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>Physiological Discoveries in the College of Therapeutics.</h2>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> resolutions of my most recent class in Boston are the same in spirit as have
		been expressed during forty years, and will no doubt be expressed again by my
		students in May, 1887. They not only know the truth of the science but recognize
		sarcognomy as “the most important addition ever made to physiological science by
		any individual,” and their testimony was based on their own personal experience.
		To the students of sarcognomy this is a familiar idea, but to others some explanation
		may be necessary.</p>

		<p>What are the greatest discoveries in physiology? Common opinion would mention
		as the foremost the action of the heart in circulating the blood,—a discovery
		not originated but consummated by Harvey; and yet the discovery is of so simple
		and obvious a nature that we wonder now, not so much at the ability manifested in
		the discovery, as at the stupidity which permitted it to remain so long unknown,
		and even to be denied and ridiculed when published. Harvey’s work on the generation
		of animals entitled him to a higher rank as a pioneer in science than his theory
		of the circulation.</p>

		<p>A far greater discovery was that of Dr. Gall, which embraced not only the anatomy
		but the functions of the brain as a mental organ—a discovery twenty times as
		great, whether we consider the superior importance of the brain, or the greater
		investigating genius necessary to the discovery. It easily ranks at the head of the
		physiological discoveries of the past centuries.</p>

		<p>Next comes the discovery of the motor and sensory roots of the spinal nerves
		by Majendie and Bell, which did not, as commonly supposed, include the motor and
		sensory of the spinal cord. This was a small discovery compared to Gall’s, but
		not inferior to Harvey’s discovery of the cardiac function.</p>

		<p>A fourth discovery, perhaps of equal rank, was the discovery by Harvey’s contemporary,
		Aselli, of the lacteals that absorb the chyle.</p>

		<p>A fifth discovery or discoveries of importance was that of the corpuscles of the
		blood, and the Malpighian bodies of the kidneys, by Malpighi.</p>

		<p>A sixth discovery, considered more important and occupying a larger space in
		medical literature, is the cell doctrine of Schwann, a doctrine still under discussion
		and by no means a finality.</p>

		<p>Anatomical science has few first class discoveries. Anatomy has been a growth
		of observation and description—not discovery. Vesalius and Eustachius may be
		considered the fathers of modern anatomy, and the name of the latter is immortalized
		by the Eustachian tube, which he first recognized and described. But the Fallopian
		tubes, named after Fallopius, were not his discovery. They had been described
		long before by Herophilus and others. Eustachius was nearly two centuries ahead
		of his age in anatomy, and should be gratefully remembered as a struggling scientist.
		His valuable anatomical works, which he was too poor to publish, were published
		one hundred and forty years after his death, by Lancisi.</p>

		<p>From this brief glance at the discoveries of Eustachius, Harvey, Aselli, Malpighi,
		Gall, Majendie, and Schwann, it is apparent that but one physiological discovery
		on record is sufficiently important in its nature and scope to be compared
		with sarcognomy, which comprehends the relations of soul, brain, and body.
		What is their relative value? Gall’s discovery embraced about one half of the
		psychic functions of the brain, with nothing of its physiological functions. Sarcognomy,
		on the contrary, embraces the entire mass of cerebral functions to
		connect them with corresponding functions in the body. It presents in one complete
		view the psychic powers in the soul operating in the brain, and extending
		their influence into the body; and on the other hand, the physiological powers of
		the body, operating through the brain, and by definite, intelligible laws acting upon
		the soul—a vast system of science, based on anatomical facts, but evolved by experiment,
		to which no single volume could do justice. Its medical applications alone,
		concisely presented in thirty lectures, would make a volume of four hundred pages.</p>

		<p>It is not, like the phrenological system of Gall, a mental doctrine only, but, combining
		psychology, physiology, and pathology, goes to the foundations of medical
		science, of health, disease, and cure, as well as the foundations of all spiritual science,
		and originates new systems of magnetic and electric practice. It is manifest,
		therefore, that no biological discovery now on record occupies more than a fraction
		of the vast area occupied by Sarcognomy, and being a demonstrated science,
		in the opinion of all who are acquainted with it, it needs only sufficient time to circulate
		the works upon the subject now in preparation (the first edition of “Therapeutic
		Sarcognomy” having been speedily exhausted), and sufficient time to
		overcome the mental inertia and moral torpor that hinder all progress, and even
		war against the million times repeated facts of spiritual science. The warfare
		against all new truth will be continued until the people demand that our colleges,
		the castles of antiquated error, shall conform to the spirit of progressive science.</p>

			liberal minds—to all who aim at the highest rank
			in their profession—to all who are strictly conscientious
			and faithful in the discharge of their
			duties to patients under their care, to have an
			institution in which their education can be completed
			by a preliminary or a post-graduate course
			of instruction.</p>

			<p>The amount of practically useful knowledge of
			the healing art which is absolutely excluded from
			the curriculum of old style medical colleges is
			greater than all they teach—not greater than the
			adjunct sciences and learning of a medical course
			which burden the mind to the exclusion of much
			useful therapeutic knowledge, but greater than
			all the curative resources embodied in their instruction.</p>

			<p>The most important of these therapeutic resources
			which have sometimes been partially
			applied by untrained persons are now presented
			in the College of Therapeutics, in which is taught
			not the knowledge which is now represented by
			the degree of M. D., but a more profound knowledge
			which gives its pupils immense advantages
			over the common graduate in medicine.</p>

			<p>Therapeutic Sarcognomy, a science often demonstrated
			and endorsed by able physicians, gives the
			anatomy not of the physical structure, but of the
			vital forces of the body and soul as located in every
			portion of the constitution—a science vastly more
			important than physical anatomy, as the anatomy
			of life is more important than the anatomy of
			death. Sarcognomy is the true basis of medical
			practice, while anatomy is the basis only of operative
			surgery and obstetrics.</p>

			<p>Indeed, every magnetic or electric practitioner
			ought to attend such a course of instruction to
			become entirely skilful in the correct treatment of
			disease.</p>

			<p>In addition to the above instruction, special
			attention will be given to the science and art of
			Psychometry—the most important addition in
			modern times to the practice of medicine, as it
			gives the physician the most perfect diagnosis of
			disease that is attainable, and the power of extending
			his practice successfully to patients at any
			distance. The methods of treatment used by
			spiritual mediums and “mind cure” practitioners
			will also be philosophically explained.</p>

			<p>The course of instruction will begin on Monday,
			the 2d of May, and continue six weeks. The fee
			for attendance on the course will be $25. To
			students who have attended heretofore the fee will
			be $15. For further information address the
			president,</p>

			<p class="sign">JOSEPH RODES BUCHANAN, M. D.<br />
			<span class="address name">6 James St., Boston.</span></p>

			<p>The sentiments of those who have attended these
			courses of instruction during the last eight years
			were concisely expressed in the following statement,
			which was unanimously signed and presented
			to Dr. Buchanan by those attending his last
			course in Boston.</p>

			<p>“The undersigned, attendant, upon the seventh
			session of the College of Therapeutics, have been
			delighted with the profound and wonderful instructions
			received, and as it is the duty of all who
			become acquainted with new truths of great
			importance to the world, to assist in their diffusion,
			we offer our free and grateful testimony in the
			following resolutions:</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the lectures and experiments of
			Prof. Buchanan have not only clearly taught,
			but absolutely demonstrated, the science of Sarcognomy,
			by experiments in which we were personally
			engaged, and in which we cannot possibly
			have been mistaken.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we regard Sarcognomy as the
			most important addition ever made to physiological
			science by any individual, and as the basis
			of the only possible scientific system of Electro-Therapeutics,
			the system which we have seen
			demonstrated in all its details by Prof. Buchanan,
			producing results which we could not have believed
			without witnessing the demonstration.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That Therapeutic Sarcognomy is a
			system of science of the highest importance, alike
			to the magnetic healer, to the electro-therapeutist,
			and to the medical practitioner,—giving great
			advantages to those who thoroughly understand it,
			and destined to carry the fame of its discoverer to
			the remotest future ages.”</p>
